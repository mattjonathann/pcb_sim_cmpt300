Design Decisions
- Init process is immediately created on program startup, and placed in ready queue 2

- Each process only keeps the lastest message sent to it.

- Scheduling based on FCFS on 3 levels of priority.
  Always finishes priority 0 first before going to 1 and 2. 
  If a new process is added to 0, then that process is next to run.

- When running a quantum, the process will go into the 'back' of its respective priority queue,
  simulating a process which have not yet been completed.

- The scheduling operation will go into a lower level queue only if its higher level queue is
  empty

- Using a quantum cannot finish a process. In order to finish a process, the user must either
  use 'E' to finish the currently running process, or use 'K' to kill the user's intended process

- Init process cannot call blocking functions. Trying to do so will produce an error message.
